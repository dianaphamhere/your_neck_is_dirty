# Repressed Memory Collection: Your Neck is Dirty

The "Repressed Memory Collection" is quite literally, a collection of repressed memories in game form. As someone who suffers with depression (as a symptom to CPTSD), I'm taking strides to uncover and face my repressed memories head on in order to move on without having to live in fear of my trauma. Creating games and other media is a way for me to express myself and cope with my mental illness. Enjoy.
